[Example with CrysisShell.](https://github.com/xy2iii/vitashell-themes/tree/master/themes/SimpleSH%5ETibyAndy) Sample README.md:
```
# (theme) by (author) (rev) # rev stands for revision, or version of your theme.

## Download link:
* [**filename.tar.xz**](https://mega.nz/Your_Link) # Providing a download link is not a requirement, as users can simply clone the repository.

## Preview:
![Preview](https://github.com/xy2iii/vitashell-themes/tree/master/themes/theme-author/preview.jpg) # If you wish to include multiple previews, please number them accordingly: preview1.jpg, preview2.jpg, etc.
```
## Downloading themes and translations

To download the entirety of the listed themes:

* download the repo as ZIP: click on 'Clone or download' and click 'Download ZIP.' This is the easier option for newbie users, but is a one-time download not kept up to date.
* [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and have it kept up to date. To "update", simply `cd` to the repository folder and `git pull`.

## Installation process

For translations, put the desired translation(s) in `ux0:VitaShell/language/`. For themes, put the desired theme (the folder itself) in `ux0:VitaShell/theme/`. You can have multiple themes at once; just put all the themes you wish to use and swap with VitaShell.
